# Tokyo Five-Day Travelogue

As a small-town student who focused on academics, I had never been abroad until I graduated from university.

During university, I became fascinated with Japanese dramas and longed to visit Japan.

After working for a few months, I finally had enough money and time.

So, in early 2020, when the domestic epidemic was quietly spreading but not yet widespread, I traveled to Tokyo alone.

Below are some notes from my trip, which might come in handy if I visit again.

## Day-1 Preparations

### Visa

I chose a service on Fliggy (an online travel platform), read the package description, and sent the required documents (passport, graduation certificate, etc.) to the vendor.

11 days later, I received my passport with the visa back from the vendor.

### Flights and Accommodation

I checked various guides and found a very useful website: https://www.tianxun.com/

It allows simultaneous searching and comparison of multiple flight and hotel websites, and you can also subscribe to price change alerts.

Both my flight and hotel for this trip were booked through it.

### Internet

I bought two SIM cards on Taobao (for backup and high availability).

PS: After arriving in Japan, I found that if you are a Huawei user, you might consider using the Skyroam service, which doesn't require changing SIM cards (but I'm no longer a Huawei user üòõ).

### Cash

I exchanged 30,000 JPY at China Merchants Bank, which seemed to have a better exchange rate than other methods.

### Transportation

As a digital native, I naturally wanted to [set up a Suica card in Apple Pay](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT207155), but it was [unsuccessful due to not having a JCB credit card](https://www.v2ex.com/t/563377).

I also tried the Suica app, which also failed. It made me complain that its user experience was far behind domestic software.

So, I decided to buy a transportation card after arriving.

### Itinerary

I planned this [itinerary](https://plan.qyer.com/trip/V2YJYVFiBzJTY1I3Cm0NPQ/?campaign=app_share_plan&category=myplan_message&client_id=qyer_planner_ios&share_platform=myplan_message&style=deepgreen&track_user_id=11047811) using Qyer's itinerary assistant.

My main goal was to visit many filming locations from Japanese dramas.

Of course, this itinerary was too packed, so I ended up visiting fewer places in reality.

## Day0 Beijing - Haneda Airport - Roppongi

I arrived at the airport early and waited for a long time. On the plane, I used Japanese for the first time in a real situation: "„Ç≥„Éº„Éí„Éº„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ" (Coffee, please).

I filled out the immigration form on the plane. When I went through customs after landing, there were already warnings about unexplained pneumonia (I was completely unaware at the time).

Before boarding the Monorail, I found a cherry blossom-themed Suica card specifically sold to tourists at the self-service ticket machine, and I bought one.

Then, I successfully connected to the internet on the train, opened Google Maps, and navigated through transfers. On the way, I even saw Tokyo Tower! (No picture here) It was a real and exciting feeling.

Finally, I arrived at the hotel and checked in. I loved the high floor and large window.

My first impressions of Tokyo: the subway is so narrow, the building heights are so low, and the rooms are so clean.

## Day1 Asakusa, Ueno, Roppongi Observatory

On the first day, I walked nearly 30,000 steps, sightseeing many places:

- Senso-ji Temple, where Gakki walked in "Legal High" (and saw Skytree incidentally)
- Ameyoko Center Building, the location of Ameyoko Girls' Academy in "Amachan"
- Ueno Zoo from Japanese textbooks
- Roppongi Observatory

After seeing the Skytree at Senso-ji Temple, I went to a Western-style restaurant. My first lunch in Tokyo was omurice and hamburg steak.

At the Asakusa Tourist Information Center, I found a 3-day unlimited subway pass and bought it, also receiving a Kamakura tourist guide. I could feel that although Japan's information efficiency is not high, its tourism services are generally complete, and Tokyo, as a tourist destination, offers a friendly experience.

I took the subway to Ueno Station. The first place I went was Ameyokocho Central Building, which was bustling with people and many food stalls, just like a pedestrian street back home. The building in the middle was the Ameyoko Girls' Academy. I learned a new word: "„É≠„Ç±Âú∞" (filming location). It was a bit funny that the "Amachan" filming location is now a designated smoking area.

Next, I came to Ueno Park. Tokyo in January was not cold, and the weather was very comfortable. There was a long queue in the park, which made me very curious. When I reached the front of the line, I found it was a Van Gogh exhibition, themed "Two Encounters That Changed a Life."

In the evening, I returned to the hotel to take a shower, then headed to the nearby Roppongi Hills to see the night view. It was already 10 PM when I left, close to closing time, so there weren't many people at the observatory. I sat alone in an empty corner, enjoying the million-dollar night view (no picture here). It was my first time seeing such a bustling city night view, and I thought it was more stunning than the Hong Kong night view I had seen before. I hope to visit again with more people next time.

Back at the hotel, I planned the next day's itinerary and discovered a super useful website: http://loca.ash.jp/ (Japanese drama filming location index, supports various search methods).

## Day2 Enoshima/Kamakura

This day, I traveled along the Enoden line, visiting many filming locations from Japanese dramas and anime such as "Saigo Kara Nibanme no Koi" (The Last Cinderella), "Our Little Sister," and "Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai."

According to the tourist guide obtained from the tourist information center, I purchased the Enoshima/Kamakura Free Pass. I took the Odakyu Electric Railway from Shinjuku to Fujisawa, then transferred to the Enoden to Enoshima Station. After exiting Enoshima Station and walking past some shops, I could see the Enoshima Observatory. It looked just like in the anime.

I followed the crowd across the pedestrian bridge and ascended to the observatory using the Enoshima escalator, enjoying the view of the Shonan coast. In the distance, I could see some sailboats anchored. It is said that Enoshima was once a venue for Olympic sailing competitions, and it will continue to be a sailing venue for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics.

After enjoying the sea view, I returned the same way. It was a weekend, with blue skies, white clouds, and a sea breeze, very pleasant.

Since I had watched "Saigo Kara Nibanme no Koi" and "Our Little Sister" before the trip, my next destination was Gokurakuji Temple. On the way to Gokurakuji, I passed Kamakura-k≈çk≈ç-mae Station. When I exited Gokurakuji Station alone, my first feeling was unreality; it was such a deserted station, without even an exit gate. My second feeling was amazement: from such a small station to crowded Shinjuku or Shibuya, it only takes an hour and a half. The rail transport is so convenient.

After exiting the station, going uphill and then downhill, you can see the Gokurakuji sign on a utility pole.

Continuing east, you can reach Yuigahama Beach. I quietly watched the sunset here and even met an uncle playing a solo by the sea.

After the sun set for a while, I continued to take the Enoden to Kamakura city. In Komachi, I ordered two sets of tonkatsu at a tonkatsu restaurant. (The part-time waitress was so beautiful! But my Japanese was too poor to strike up a conversation.)

After dinner, I took the Enoden back to Fujisawa (the heated seats were so warm, and combined with the post-dinner drowsiness, I couldn't help but doze off on the train), then transferred to the Odakyu Electric Railway back to Shinjuku, ending a day of touring.

## Day3 Yoyogi Park, Shibuya

This day, I didn't plan for distant destinations and took the subway to Yoyogi Park. It was a Sunday, and I felt the Sunday atmosphere in the park.

Then I walked from Harajuku Station to Omotesando Station, then went to Shibuya to join the crowd, and finally ventured alone into a sushi restaurant in Roppongi for dinner.

After dinner, I tried the classic photo spot below Roppongi Hills.

## Day4 Tokyo Station, Haneda Airport - Beijing

On the last day, I went to Tokyo Station to buy some souvenirs:

Then I bought some snacks at Haneda Airport, such as Shiroi Koibito and Tokyo Banana.

## Postscript

This trip was my first time traveling abroad alone, and so far, my only one. I hope to have the opportunity to visit again in the future.
